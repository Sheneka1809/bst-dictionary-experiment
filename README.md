# Dictionary using Binary Search Tree

This is a small learning experiment where a simple dictionary (only a few words and meanings) is implemented using a Binary Search Tree.

Although Trie is the standard data structure for dictionaries, this implementation was done to explore how BSTs can be applied in alternative ways and to understand their internal behavior.

This project currently uses a single file and a small dataset, and is intended for learning purposes.
